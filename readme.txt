At part one, i was asked to write a convolution function for discrete time and compare it with numpy's convolution function.
	Also record my voice in 5 and 10 second time periods, apply the functions to them and observe the results.
At part two, i was asked to encode my own phone number's dtmf frequencies from an array, convert it to a .wav file and write a code that decodes the .wav file automatically to an array.
	Also as a practice, i was given a unknown .wav file to decode it into its numbers.
